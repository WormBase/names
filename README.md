# wormbase-names

This repository provides:
 - A web app that facilitates the sharing of identifiers and names of a subset of WormBase data types.
 - A shared library (functions used within the datomic transactor, and the web app)
 - A command line application to export the data from the names service.

The web app comprises:

 - A REST API for manipulating WormBase data types
   - Recording new entities, updating, changing entity status and more.
 - A Web interface, providing forms to perform operations via the REST API.
 - A library `wormbase.ids` that is used by the REST API to perform atomic
   identifier operations within a datomic transactor process.
 - Schema and database related functions
   The schema and related database functions are intended to evolve to
   eventually become the "central" database within the WormBase
   architecture.
 - A basic user interface to interact with the name-service.
 - Serialisation of events to a queueing system, such that those
   events can be "replayed" into various ACeDB databases.
 - User authentication (agianst the wormbase.org google organisation)

With every write operation, this names service provides provenance (who, when, where and why),
which is modelled as attributes on the "transaction entity".

## Development

### Setup

```bash
cd /tmp
lein upgrade
```

Ensure you've installed the following software on your system:

[clojure 1.9][4]

[leineningen 2.8.1+][5]

[nodejs][6]

[yarn][7]

[docker][8]

[awscli][9]

[awsebcli][10]

#### Docker credentials

The Makefile target `ecr-login` command will, by default, store the
authentication token un-encrypted in the file: `~/.docker/config.json`.

There is a plugin that can be used to use a store to save these tokens encrypted,
but varies depending on operating system.

For linux, there's [docker-credential-pass][12] and [pass][13], which can be used together,
which uses a GPG2 key to encrypt tokens.


### Setup client app
Setup client app **either by [making a production build of the client app](#building-the-client-app) or running a client development server**, as show here:

- First, ensure `client/package.json` has proxy configured to point at the backend API.

- Then, run:
```bash
cd client/
yarn install
yarn run start
```

- Finally, ensure the authentication callback URL at Google Cloud Console is configured to match the client development server configuration.

Notes:
- `client/` is bootstrapped with [create-react-app][11], where you can find out more about its setup and capability
- **Port:**
	- To run the server on a different port:
```bash
PORT=[PORT] yarn run start
```
- **Dependencies:**
	- Most errors about missing dependencies can be resolved with `yarn install`.
	- It's safe to run `yarn install` when in doubt.
	- Refer to [yarn][7] documentation when modifying dependencies. And be sure to checking in changes in `yarn.lock` (auto-generated).
- **Mock:**
	- Ajax calls through `mockFetchOrNot` function allows one to provide a mock implementation of an API call, in addition to the native API call.
	- Whether the mock implementation or the native implementation is invoked is determined by the 3rd argument (`shouldMock`) passed to mockFetchOrNot function.
	- `shouldMock` defaults to the `REACT_APP_SHOULD_MOCK` environment variable, when it's not passed in as an argument.
- **Directory structure**
	- [create-react-app][11] is responsible for the directory structure of `client/` except `client/src`, and relies it staying this way.
	- `client/src` primarily consists of `containers` (React components involving business logic) `components/elements` (React components involving only appearance and/or UI logic).

### Run the application locally
Run with:

```bash
export WB_DB_URI="[datomic-uri]"
```

(An example of `[datomic-uri]` may be `datomic:mem://localhost:4334/names`. No transactor setup is needed for this in-memory database URI. For a persistent database, a transactor needs to be configured, in which case, the `[datomic-uri]` is based the your transactor configuration and database name.)

Run with `lein ring server [port]` or `lein ring server-headless [port]`.

To allow the UI webpackDevServer to proxy to the ring server, the ring server has to be run at the host and port configured in the `"proxy"` section in [client/package.json](client/package.json).


### Tools

#### Running a Clojure REPL
If using Emacs + CIDER:
```bash
clj -A:datomic-pro:aws-java-sdk-dynamodb -Sdeps '{:deps {cider/cider-nrepl {:mvn/version "0.22.0-beta4"}}}' -m nrepl.cmdline --middleware "[cider.nrepl/cider-middleware]"
```
Otherwise, for a plain REPL use:
```bash
clj -A:datomic-pro:aws-java-sdk-dynamodb -m nrepl.cmdline
```

From time to time it is good to check for outdated dependencies.
This can be done via the following command:
```
clj -A:outdated
```


### Testing
Use built-in testing utilities as provided by leiningen.
Please run all tests before committing/submitting new pull requests.

## Releases

```bash
lein release
```

### Building the client application
```bash
make build-client-app
```

For a full list of tasks, type:

```bash
make help
```

### Importing from GeneACe export data

Conventionally, the export files have been named in the form: `DDMMYYY_<topic>`,
and we give the datomic database a corresponding name.

The best way to run the imports is against a local `datomic:ddb-local` or `datomic:dev` transactor.

e.g: dynamodb-local

export WB_DB_URI="datmomic:ddb-local://localhost:8000/WSNames/12022019 # The Dynamo DB table here is `WSNames`

See [here][14] for creating a local DynamoDB database.

#### Import genes

This import pipeline takes two files:
  - <current_status_tsv> : A file containing the columns: WBGeneID, Species, Status, CGC Name, Sequence Name, Biotype.
  - <actions_tsv>: A file containing WBGeneID, WBPersonID, Timestamp, Event Type


```bash
lein run import gene <current_status_tsv> <actions.tsv>
```
At time of writing (as of WormBase release WS270), the gene import pipeline takes ~5 hours to run.

#### Import variations

The variations export data is provided in a single file (no provenance is attached).

```bash
lein import variations <variations_tsv>
```

At time of writing (as of WormBase release WS270), the variations
import pipeline takes ~5 mins to run.


### Import Sequence Features

We do not attempt to replay all Sequence features from an export,
and instead just record the latest ID and status.

From a fresh database install, enter the following from a REPL session
after exporting the `WB_DB_URI` environment variable appropriately:

```clojure
(require '[environ.core :refer [env]])
(require '[datomic.api :as d])
(def conn (d/connect (:wb-db-uri conn)))
@(d/transact conn [{:sequence-feature/id "<latest-id>", :sequence-feature/status :sequence-feature.status/live}
				  {:db/id "datomic.tx", :provenance/why "Initial import", :provenance/who [:person/id "YourWBPersonID"]}])
```

### Restoring the datomic database to AWS

Creation of a new remote DynamoDB database should be done via the AWS CLI or web console (outside of the scope of this document).

Follow the "standard" backup-and-restore method, for example:

```bash
mkdir $HOME/names-db-backups
cd ~/datomic-pro/datomic-pro-0.9.5703
bin/datomic backup-db $LOCAL_DATOMIC_URI file://$HOME/names-db-backups/names-db
```

Before restoring the database:
 - Make a note of the current value of `write-capacity`
 - Increase the `write-capacity` of the DDB table via the AWS CLI/web
   console to be 1000 (or more), then run the restore command shown
   below.

```bash
bin/datomic restore-db file://$HOME/names-db-backups/names-db $REMOTE_DATOMIC_URI
```
After the process concludes, restore the `write-capacity` back to its original value.

Ensure to configure the application via the `.ebextensions/app-env.config` file to match $REMOTE_DATOMIC_URI.
After deploying a release, verify that the URI has changed in the ElasticBeanStalk configuration section.
